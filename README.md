These phonetic data contain over 13,000 pronunications and tests which factors significantly affect the dependent variable of a "Southern" pronuncation, measured in euclidean distance from the beginning to ending of the 'AY' vowel among Southern broadasters. The demographic predictors were re-leveled so that the reference level among the categorical predictors was always the most represented demographic. The initial model used all independent variables and then were narrowed down using the step function until only three independent variables showed to be meet traditional thresholds of statistical significance - gender, occupational role, and subregion ('Deep South' vs. the Southern periphery). Because this is a hierarchical model that more closely examines the demographic predictors, the individual speakers were treated as a random varaible with randomized intercepts in the model. The modeled residuals were then tested for normality, which validated the linear model.
